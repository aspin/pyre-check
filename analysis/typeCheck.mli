  (* `configuration` provides access to global options.

     `resolution` provides access to the local and global type environment.

     `errors` is a map from locations to errors. We assume there can be only
     one error per location.

     `define` is the function we're currently checking.

     `nested_defines` keeps track of entry points and states for nested function definitions.

     `bottom` indicates whether the state is reachable.

     The order is defined by values of the map, i.e.
     left <= right <=>
        keys(left) \subset \keys(right) \and
        \forall key \in keys(left): left(key) <= right(key)

     The join takes the union of keys and does an element-wise join on the
     values. *)
